# Parallax Website

Welcome to the Parallax Website project! This is a simple website featuring a parallax effect, created using HTML and CSS.

## Overview

The parallax website provides a visually engaging experience by incorporating a parallax scrolling effect. This effect creates a sense of depth by moving background elements at a different speed than foreground elements.
