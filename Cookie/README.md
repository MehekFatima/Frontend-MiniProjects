## About Cookies

- **Purpose**: Cookies allow websites to remember users and their preferences, such as login status, language settings, and shopping cart contents.
- **Storage**: Cookies are stored locally on the user's device, typically in the browser's cookie storage.
- **Expiration**: Cookies can have an expiration date, after which they are automatically deleted by the browser. This expiration can be set using attributes like `expires` or `max-age`.
